# Discrete Optimization Project

Welcome! This project is to explore the properties of linear optimization based on varying constraint conditions.
Please read the proposal for further details on the motivation and goal of what this project is trying to achieve.

To run scripts:

main.py -p <penalization: quadratic or none> -w <weighted: yes or no>
(ex. "main.py -p qudratic -w yes")
